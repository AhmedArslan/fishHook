\usage{
Annotated
}
\arguments{
\item{targets}{Examples of targets are genes, enhancers, 1kb tiles of the genome that we can then convert into a rolling window. This param must be of class "GRanges".}

\item{events}{Events are the given mutational regions and must be of class "GRanges". Examples of events are mutational data (e.g. C->G) copy number variations and fusion events. Targets are the given regions of the genome to annotate and must be of class "GRanges".}

\item{covered}{This is equivalent to Eligible in the FishHook class. Eligible are the regions of the genome that we feel are fit to score. For example in the case of exome sequencing where not all regions are equally represented, eligible can be a set of regions that meet an arbitrary coverage threshold. Another example of when to use eligibility is in the case of whole genomes, where your targets are 1kb tiles. Regions of the genome you would want to exclude in this case are highly repetative regions such as centromeres, telomeres, and satelite repeates. This param must be of class "GRanges".}

\item{covariates}{Covariates are genomic covariates that you belive will cause your given type of event (mutations, CNVs, fusions) that are not linked to the process you are investigating (e.g. cancer biology). In the case of cancer biology we are looking for regions that are mutated as part of cancer progression, and regions that are more suceptable to random mutagenesis such as late replicating or non-expressed region (transcription coupled repair) are potential false positives. Includinig covariates for these will reduce thier prominence in the final data. This param must be of type "Cov_Arr" which can be created by wrapping Cov objects in c(). e.g. c(Cov1,Cov2,Cov3).}

Annotate Obeject that can be scored & manipulated and aggregated.

\description{
Stores the annotated data from a FishHook object. and allows users to aggregate,manipulate and score that data. This object should be generated by calling FishHook$annotateTargets(). Note that this is where the meat of the computational burden lies. For example, in our test cases, running 8k pts worth of exome seq on 20k genes took 20seconds without covariates and 20sec + ~5min per covariate added.
